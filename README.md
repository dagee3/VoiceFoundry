# VoiceFoundry

1.  I tried to implement my solution in several ways.  The first way I did was try to use iterations of the code and get all possible letters for each number.  The part I struggled with was finding out how to create the possible combinations.  Another approach was I tried to build a tree and this did not work either as iterating through it was not as easy as I initially thought.  Thw whole coding excercise was quite difficult and in the end I was unable to come up with a working solution.  I overcame several small problems throughout and was able to get something to output but not the answers we were looking for.  Since there are over 59,000 potential possibilities I think that this may not be the easiest solution.  This needs to probably be broken down into multiple functions that work together to create each possibility.
  
2.  I took several shortcuts such as not creating testing first, not documenting my code, and also did not write testing first.

3.  If I had more time I would have broken this down into seperate components to build it in a less clunky and cluttered way.
